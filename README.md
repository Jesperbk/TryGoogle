# Try Google

Try Google is a Firefox plugin that enables the user to retry his or her search from one search engine (e.g. DuckDuckGo or Ecosia) in Google. If the results from the users preferred search engine are unsatisfactory, Try Google lets them do the same search in Google with just a single click.

## Limitations
Try Google assumes the current search engine uses the `q` parameter for the search terms. If no `q` parameter is present, Try Google takes no action.
